    "###  Rules of Craps (Vegas Casino Style)\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "The basic rules are outlined below and a several common betting options are given.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Come-Out Roll\n",
    " - The game begins with the shooter making a \"come-out\" roll using two six-sided dice.\n",
    " - If the come-out roll is a **7 or 11**, the pass line bet wins (called a \"natural\").\n",
    " - If the come-out roll is **2, 3, or 12**, the pass line bet loses (called \"craps\").\n",
    " - If the come-out roll is **4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10**, that number becomes the **point**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Point Phase\n",
    " - Once the point is established, the shooter continues rolling.\n",
    " - The goal is to roll the **point number again before rolling a 7**.\n",
    "     - If the shooter rolls the point again, pass line bets win.\n",
    "     - If the shooter rolls a **7 before the point**, pass line bets lose (called \"seven out\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Some Betting Options\n",
    " - **Pass Line Bet**: Wins on a natural (7 or 11), loses on craps (2, 3, 12), wins if point is hit before a 7.\n",
    " - **Don't Pass Bet**: Opposite of pass line. Wins on craps (2, 3), ties on 12, loses on 7 or 11.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " ### Part 1\n",
    " Determine the odds of winning at craps for the Pass Line Bet and Don't Pass Bet.\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Part 2\n",
    " Use probabilistic/Monte-Carlo methods for estimating the odds of winning the Pass Line and Don't Pass Line Bets."

    "You approach two slot machines. Each machine costs $\\$.050$ to play and pays out $\\$1$ for a win. You do not know the exact probability of winning on either machine, but you are told that **one has a 2/5 chance of winning**, and the **other has a 3/5 chance of winning**. You do not know which machine has which probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to use probabilistic methods to compare two strategies over a total of 100 plays, to see which strategy is more profitable on average. A more profitable strategy is one that tends to allocate more plays to the machine with the higher payout probability.\n",

    "### Strategies to Simulate\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loss-Switch Strategy:**  \n",
    "   Select a slot machine at random. Play on that machine until you lose, then switch to the other machine. Repeat this process for 100 plays.\n",

    "2. **Exploration-Exploitation Strategy:**  \n",
    "   Start by playing each machine 10 times. Estimate the win rate for each machine based on these initial plays. Then:\n",
    "   - Continue playing the machine with the higher observed win rate.\n",
    "   - After each play, update the estimated win rate.\n",
    "   - If the other machine’s estimated win rate becomes higher, switch to it.\n",

    "While this is a simplified, hypothetical scenario, it mirrors real-world decision-making under uncertainty. For instance, in finance, a trader might have multiple strategies available for a given asset. The decision of which strategy to follow at a given time can be based on adaptive rules informed by past performance, similar in spirit to the strategies explored here."
